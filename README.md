# ReactorSim

A simple simulation of a nuclear reactor that I made using an HTML5 canvas and pure JavaScript.

A working (as much is done) demo is located [here](https://grrrwoofwoofuwurawr.tech/reactorsim/).

## IT IS NOT DONE!!

TODO:

 - Add Particle / Control Rod Collision
 - Add Particle / Element Collision
 - Add Particle Release Upon Collision
 - Add "Geiger Counter"
 - Heavy Optimizations

## Notes on Accuracy

The following items should not be considered a 100% accurate representation of real-world conditions (I am not a nuclear engineer yet):

 - Random Decay Rates
 - CPM and uSv/hr
 - Particle Size
 - Decay Chance
 - Water Temperature

I did plenty of research on these items, but they should only be used to get the overall idea of how parts of a reactor interact. The figures produced by this simulation may not be to scale.
